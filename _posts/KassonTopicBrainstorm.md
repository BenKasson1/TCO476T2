**Instruction Sets for a Ben Kasson Breakfast!**
------------------------------------------------

 

Idea for Interface:

**Home page** of Ben Breakfast has images prominently featured with an
explanation, like ”Click each dish to learn how Ben makes it!”. Below the image
board will be a brief purpose statement, explaining that the images act as links
leading to separate instructional cooking modules, with step by step
walkthoughs, relevant sources, and videos on each page. (I am considering making
and including my own accompanying video for each lesson. Wouldn't be too hard.)

The message could be as simple as “Welcome to BKB, we strive to make breakfast
the celebration it deserves to be. Use our recipes to spice up your morning, or
share the experience with your friends. Let us know how your creations turn out
using the comment section at the bottom of each instruction set.”

 

At the bottom of each of the modules will be a blog style comment section, where
visitors can leave critiques or compliments or comments about the recipes, or
share instruction sets on social media.

 

Here are some examples of content for the **instructional pages**:

one batch.

**Eating a Banana**

| 1. Acquire ingredients          | Simply get yourself a banana, and a knife if you’d prefer sliced banana.                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2. Hold the banana              | Grip the fruit with the stem facing towards the ground.                                                                                                                |
| 3. Peel the banana              | grip the top of the banana with your index finger and thumb, now slowly move your hand down the side of the banana while maintaining your hold on the top of the peel. |
| 4. Follow through               | peel the rest of the banana using the same technique as described in step 3.[^5]                                                                                       |
| 5. Consume or get fancy with it | Either eat it straight up, or if your like me, slice it over a bowl of cereal using the knife.                                                                         |
