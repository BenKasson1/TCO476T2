**Batch o' Bacon**

![](http://stroupefarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Bacon-peppered.jpg)

1) Gather ingredients

Aluminum foil, oven pan, package of bacon, brown sugar, pepper.

2) Prepare oven

Preheat to 400\* F.

3) Prepare pan

Cover the oven pan bottom w/ aluminum foil. This makes cleanup a breeze!

4) Lay bacon

Cover aluminum foil with four strips of bacon, or however many you want. Add another sheet of aluminum foil if you want multiple layers of bacon in one batch.

5) Spice it up

Treat each strip of bacon with a combination of pepper and brown sugar. I use almost as much pepper as I do brown sugar

6) Bake em

When oven is 400\*, insert oven pan and set timer for 16 min.

7) Eat or store

Remove from oven, after 3-5 min serve or store in resealable container
